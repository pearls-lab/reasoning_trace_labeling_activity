REASONING TRACE:

<think> Okay, so I need to find $ x_{2025} $ in this sequence defined by $ x_1 = \frac{25}{11} $ and the recursive formula $ x_{k+1} = \frac{1}{3}\left(x_k + \frac{1}{x_k} - 1\right) $. Then express it as a reduced fraction $ \frac{m}{n} $ and find $ m + n \mod 1000 $. First, let me try to understand the sequence. It starts with $ x_1 = \frac{25}{11} $, and each term is defined based on the previous one. The recursion is $ x_{k+1} = \frac{1}{3}(x_k + \frac{1}{x_k} - 1) $. Hmm, this seems like a recursive sequence that might converge to a fixed point or have some pattern. Since we need to find the 2025th term, which is a very large index, maybe there's a pattern or periodicity? Alternatively, maybe the sequence converges to a specific value, and after many iterations, it approaches that value. But since the problem says that $ x_{2025} $ can be expressed as a reduced fraction, it's likely that the sequence becomes periodic or stabilizes at some rational number after some steps. Let me check the first few terms to see if there's a pattern. Starting with $ x_1 = \frac{25}{11} $. Let me compute $ x_2 $: $ x_2 = \frac{1}{3}\left( \frac{25}{11} + \frac{1}{25/11} - 1 \right) $ First compute $ \frac{1}{25/11} = \frac{11}{25} $. Then: $ x_2 = \frac{1}{3}\left( \frac{25}{11} + \frac{11}{25} - 1 \right) $ Let me compute each term: Convert all to fractions with common denominator. Let me compute $ \frac{25}{11} + \frac{11}{25} $: First, common denominator is 275. So: $ \frac{25}{11} = \frac{25 \times 25}{275} = \frac{625}{275} $ Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, 11*25=275. So: $ \frac{25}{11} = \frac{25 \times 25}{11 \times 25} = \frac{625}{275} $ Wait, actually, no. Wait, to convert $ \frac{25}{11} $ to denominator 275, multiply numerator and denominator by 25: 25*25=625, denominator 11*25=275. Similarly, $ \frac{11}{25} = \frac{11 \times 11}{25 \times 11} = \frac{121}{275} $. Therefore: $ \frac{25}{11} + \frac{11}{25} = \frac{625 + 121}{275} = \frac{746}{275} $ Then subtract 1: $ \frac{746}{275} - 1 = \frac{746 - 275}{275} = \frac{471}{275} $ Then multiply by 1/3: $ x_2 = \frac{471}{275 \times 3} = \frac{471}{825} $ Simplify this fraction. Let's see if 471 and 825 have common factors. Divide numerator and denominator by 3: 471 ÷ 3 = 157, 825 ÷ 3 = 275. So $ x_2 = \frac{157}{275} $ Wait, 157 is a prime? Let me check. 157 divided by 2, no. 3? 1+5+7=13, not divisible by 3. 5? No. 7? 7*22=154, 157-154=3, not divisible by 7. 11? 11*14=154, same as above. 13? 13*12=156, 157-156=1. So yes, 157 is prime. 275 factors into 5^2 * 11. So 157 and 275 share no common factors. Therefore, $ x_2 = \frac{157}{275} $. Now compute $ x_3 $: $ x_3 = \frac{1}{3}\left( \frac{157}{275} + \frac{1}{157/275} - 1 \right) $ Compute $ \frac{1}{157/275} = \frac{275}{157} $ So: $ x_3 = \frac{1}{3}\left( \frac{157}{275} + \frac{275}{157} - 1 \right) $ Again, compute $ \frac{157}{275} + \frac{275}{157} $. Let me find common denominator. The denominators are 275 and 157. Since 275 = 5^2 * 11 and 157 is prime, they are coprime. Therefore, common denominator is 275*157. Compute numerator: $ 157 * 157 + 275 * 275 $. Let me compute that: First, 157^2: 157*157. Let me compute 150^2 + 2*150*7 + 7^2 = 22500 + 2100 + 49 = 24649. Wait, but 157^2 is actually: Wait, 157*157: Let me compute 160^2 = 25600. Then subtract 3*160 + 3^2? Wait, no. Wait, (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2. Let me think. Alternatively, compute 157*157: Multiply 157 * 150 = 23550, then 157 * 7 = 1099. So total is 23550 + 1099 = 24649. Yes, same as before. So 157^2 = 24649. Similarly, 275^2: 275*275. Let me compute that. 275^2 = (200 + 75)^2 = 200^2 + 2*200*75 + 75^2 = 40000 + 30000 + 5625 = 75625. Therefore, numerator is 24649 + 75625 = 100274. Therefore, the sum $ \frac{157}{275} + \frac{275}{157} = \frac{100274}{275*157} $. Then subtract 1: $ \frac{100274}{275*157} - 1 = \frac{100274 - 275*157}{275*157} $. Compute 275*157. Let me compute 275*150 = 41250, and 275*7 = 1925, so total is 41250 + 1925 = 43175. So numerator is 100274 - 43175 = 57099. Therefore, the entire expression is $ \frac{57099}{275*157*3} $. Wait, no. Wait, the entire expression for $ x_3 $ is $ \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{57099}{275*157} $. Therefore: $ x_3 = \frac{57099}{3 * 275 * 157} $. Let me compute 57099 divided by 3 first. 57099 ÷ 3: 3*19000 = 57000, so 57099 - 57000 = 99, so 19000 + 33 = 19033. Therefore, $ x_3 = \frac{19033}{275*157} $. Now compute denominator: 275*157. Earlier, we had 275*157 = 43175. Therefore, $ x_3 = \frac{19033}{43175} $. Now check if this reduces. Let me check if 19033 and 43175 have common factors. Let me check GCD(19033, 43175). Let's use the Euclidean algorithm. Compute GCD(43175, 19033): First, divide 43175 by 19033. 19033*2 = 38066. Subtract from 43175: 43175 - 38066 = 5109. So GCD(19033, 5109). Now divide 19033 by 5109. 5109*3 = 15327. Subtract: 19033 - 15327 = 3706. GCD(5109, 3706). Divide 5109 by 3706: 3706*1 = 3706. Subtract: 5109 - 3706 = 1403. GCD(3706, 1403). Divide 3706 by 1403: 1403*2 = 2806. Subtract: 3706 - 2806 = 900. GCD(1403, 900). Divide 1403 by 900: 900*1 = 900. Subtract: 1403 - 900 = 503. GCD(900, 503). Divide 900 by 503: 503*1 = 503. Subtract: 900 - 503 = 397. GCD(503, 397). Divide 503 by 397: 397*1 = 397. Subtract: 503 - 397 = 106. GCD(397, 106). Divide 397 by 106: 106*3 = 318. Subtract: 397 - 318 = 79. GCD(106, 79). Divide 106 by 79: 79*1 = 79. Subtract: 106 - 79 = 27. GCD(79, 27). Divide 79 by 27: 27*2 = 54. Subtract: 79 - 54 = 25. GCD(27, 25). Divide 27 by 25: 25*1 = 25. Subtract: 27 - 25 = 2. GCD(25, 2). Divide 25 by 2: 2*12 = 24. Subtract: 25 - 24 = 1. GCD(2, 1). Which is 1. Therefore, GCD(19033, 43175) = 1. Therefore, $ x_3 = \frac{19033}{43175} $. Hmm, so the fractions are getting more complicated. Maybe computing more terms isn't the way to go. Maybe there's a pattern or invariant here? Alternatively, maybe this sequence is designed to converge to a fixed point. Let me check if there's a fixed point. Suppose that $ x = \frac{1}{3}(x + \frac{1}{x} - 1) $. Let me solve for x. Multiply both sides by 3: $ 3x = x + \frac{1}{x} - 1 $ Subtract x: $ 2x = \frac{1}{x} - 1 $ Multiply both sides by x: $ 2x^2 = 1 - x $ Bring all terms to left: $ 2x^2 + x - 1 = 0 $ Solve quadratic equation: $ x = \frac{ -1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8} }{4} = \frac{ -1 \pm 3 }{4} $ Therefore, solutions are $ x = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} $ or $ x = \frac{ -4 }{4 } = -1 $. So the fixed points are $ \frac{1}{2} $ and -1. Since our initial term is positive (25/11), and the recursion seems to involve positive terms (since if x_k is positive, then 1/x_k is positive, so x_{k+1} is (x_k + 1/x_k -1)/3. Let me check if x_k is positive. Starting with x1 positive, then x2 is positive? Let me check: x1 is 25/11 > 0. Then 1/x1 is positive. So x2 is (positive + positive - 1)/3. Let me check if it's positive. Let me compute x1 + 1/x1 - 1: For x1 = 25/11, which is approx 2.27. Then 1/x1 is approx 0.44. So 2.27 + 0.44 - 1 ≈ 1.71, which is positive. So x2 is positive. Similarly, x3 would be positive. So all terms are positive. Therefore, the sequence is staying positive, so the fixed point is likely 1/2. Let me check if the sequence approaches 1/2. But since the problem is asking for x_{2025}, which is very far out, maybe the sequence converges to 1/2? But the problem says that x_{2025} can be expressed as a reduced fraction. If it's converging to 1/2, then maybe after some steps, it becomes exactly 1/2? Or maybe it's periodic? Alternatively, maybe the sequence is designed to reach 1/2 after some steps? Let me check if x3 is approaching 1/2. Let me compute approximate decimal values. x1 = 25/11 ≈ 2.2727 x2 = 157/275 ≈ 0.5709 x3 = 19033 / 43175 ≈ let me compute that. Let me divide numerator and denominator by something? Maybe approximate decimal: Divide 19033 by 43175. Let me note that 43175 * 0.44 = 43175 * 0.4 + 43175 * 0.04 = 17270 + 1727 = 18997. Which is very close to 19033. So 0.44 + (19033 - 18997)/43175 ≈ 0.44 + 36/43175 ≈ 0.44 + 0.00083 ≈ 0.4408. So x3 ≈ 0.4408. Then compute x4. Let me try to compute x4: x4 = 1/3*(x3 + 1/x3 - 1). Let me approximate x3 ≈ 0.4408. Compute 1/x3 ≈ 1/0.4408 ≈ 2.268. Then x3 + 1/x3 ≈ 0.4408 + 2.268 ≈ 2.7088. Subtract 1: 1.7088. Divide by 3: ≈ 0.5696. So x4 ≈ 0.5696. Then x5 would be 1/3*(x4 + 1/x4 - 1). Let me compute x4 ≈ 0.5696. 1/x4 ≈ 1.757. Then x4 + 1/x4 ≈ 0.5696 + 1.757 ≈ 2.3266. Subtract 1: 1.3266. Divide by 3: ≈ 0.4422. So x5 ≈ 0.4422. Then x6 ≈ 1/3*(0.4422 + 1/0.4422 -1). 1/0.4422 ≈ 2.261. So 0.4422 + 2.261 ≈ 2.7032. Subtract 1: 1.7032. Divide by 3: ≈ 0.5677. So x6 ≈ 0.5677. x7 ≈ 1/3*(0.5677 + 1/0.5677 - 1). 1/0.5677 ≈ 1.762. So 0.5677 + 1.762 ≈ 2.3297. Subtract 1: 1.3297. Divide by 3: ≈ 0.4432. x8 ≈ 1/3*(0.4432 + 1/0.4432 -1). 1/0.4432 ≈ 2.256. So 0.4432 + 2.256 ≈ 2.6992. Subtract 1: 1.6992. Divide by 3: ≈ 0.5664. So it seems like the sequence is oscillating between values around 0.44 and 0.57, getting closer to 1/2? Wait, but 0.44 is less than 1/2, and 0.57 is more than 1/2. Wait, but if it's converging to 1/2, then the oscillations might be decreasing? Let me check with more precise calculations. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern here. Let me check the exact values. Wait, x1 ≈ 2.27, x2 ≈ 0.57, x3 ≈ 0.44, x4 ≈ 0.57, x5 ≈ 0.44, x6 ≈ 0.57, x7 ≈ 0.44... Wait, this seems like it's oscillating between two values? If that's the case, then maybe the sequence is periodic with period 2? Let me check if x3 is equal to x1 or something? Wait, x1 = 25/11 ≈ 2.27, x3 ≈ 0.44, which is different. But x2 ≈ 0.57, x4 ≈ 0.57? Wait, no, x4 ≈ 0.5696, which is close to x2 ≈ 0.5709. Maybe the sequence is converging to a cycle of period 2? Or maybe it's approaching 1/2? Wait, but if the sequence is oscillating between two values, then maybe it's approaching a fixed point? Wait, but fixed points are 1/2 and -1. If the sequence is oscillating between two values, maybe approaching 1/2? Alternatively, maybe there's a transformation here. Let me think. The recursion is $ x_{k+1} = \frac{1}{3}(x_k + \frac{1}{x_k} - 1) $. Maybe there's a substitution that can linearize this recursion? Alternatively, perhaps if we consider the sequence in terms of continued fractions or something else. Alternatively, maybe define y_k = something related to x_k, such that the recursion becomes linear? Alternatively, think about the recursion as a function f(x) = (x + 1/x - 1)/3. Maybe analyze the behavior of this function. Alternatively, since the problem is about a very large term, maybe the sequence eventually becomes periodic or reaches a fixed point. But given that the first few terms are not approaching 1/2 quickly, maybe there's another approach. Wait, but let me check if x_{k} satisfies some relation. Let me suppose that after some steps, the sequence reaches 1/2. Let me check if applying the recursion to 1/2 gives 1/2: f(1/2) = (1/2 + 1/(1/2) - 1)/3 = (1/2 + 2 - 1)/3 = (1/2 + 1)/3 = (3/2)/3 = 1/2. Yes, so 1/2 is a fixed point. Similarly, f(-1) = (-1 + (-1) -1)/3 = (-3)/3 = -1, so -1 is also a fixed point. But our sequence is positive, so it's approaching 1/2? But in our earlier calculations, the terms are oscillating between values around 0.44 and 0.57, which are both close to 1/2. Maybe it's converging to 1/2, but very slowly? However, since we need the exact value at term 2025, which is a huge number, maybe it's exactly 1/2? But that seems unlikely unless the sequence reaches 1/2 at some point and stays there. But looking at the first few terms, it's not yet at 1/2. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern where the sequence alternates between two fractions, and since 2025 is odd or even, we can determine which one it is? Wait, let me check if the sequence is periodic with period 2. Let me check if x3 relates to x1 somehow. Let me compute x3 in exact terms. Earlier, x3 was 19033 / 43175. Let me see if there's a relation between x1 and x3. Let me check if x3 = something related to x1. Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between x_{k+2} and x_k? Let me try to compute x3 in terms of x1. Alternatively, maybe define a transformation. Let me think. Suppose we have the recursion: x_{k+1} = (x_k + 1/x_k - 1)/3. Let me rearrange this equation: Multiply both sides by 3: 3x_{k+1} = x_k + 1/x_k - 1 Rearranged: x_k + 1/x_k = 3x_{k+1} + 1. Let me denote y_k = x_k + 1/x_k. Then the equation becomes: y_k = 3x_{k+1} + 1. But also, note that y_{k+1} = x_{k+1} + 1/x_{k+1}. So if I can find a relation between y_k and y_{k+1}, maybe? But from the above, y_k = 3x_{k+1} + 1. Let me express x_{k+1} in terms of y_k: x_{k+1} = (y_k - 1)/3. Then, y_{k+1} = x_{k+1} + 1/x_{k+1} = (y_k - 1)/3 + 3/(y_k - 1). Therefore, y_{k+1} = (y_k - 1)/3 + 3/(y_k - 1). This seems complicated, but maybe we can find a recurrence for y_k? Alternatively, maybe if we define z_k = something else. Alternatively, think about the equation: Let me consider that if the sequence converges to 1/2, then y_k approaches 1/2 + 2 = 5/2. Let me check: If x approaches 1/2, then y = x + 1/x approaches 1/2 + 2 = 5/2. Then according to the relation y_k = 3x_{k+1} + 1, if x_{k+1} approaches 1/2, then y_k approaches 3*(1/2) + 1 = 3/2 + 1 = 5/2. Which matches. So that's consistent. But how does this help me? Alternatively, maybe if I can find that y_k satisfies a linear recurrence? Let me try to compute y_{k+1} in terms of y_k. From above: y_{k+1} = (y_k - 1)/3 + 3/(y_k - 1) This seems non-linear. Maybe not helpful. Alternatively, perhaps there's a substitution. Let me think. Let me consider that if I set x_k = (a_k + b_k)/something? Not sure. Alternatively, think about continued fractions or something else. Alternatively, maybe the sequence is designed so that after some steps, it reaches 1/2. But given that the first few terms are not close to 1/2 yet, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern where each term is related to the previous one through some transformation. Let me check if x2 is related to x1 in a way that can be generalized. Alternatively, perhaps consider that the recursion resembles the Newton-Raphson method for finding roots. For example, Newton-Raphson for finding sqrt(a) is x_{n+1} = (x_n + a/x_n)/2. But our recursion is different: it's (x + 1/x - 1)/3. Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe think of the recursion as a combination of operations. Let me try to write the recursion again: x_{k+1} = (x_k + 1/x_k - 1)/3. Let me rearrange: Multiply both sides by 3: 3x_{k+1} = x_k + 1/x_k - 1. Let me rearrange terms: x_k - 3x_{k+1} + 1/x_k = 1. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe consider multiplying both sides by x_k: 3x_k x_{k+1} = x_k^2 + 1 - x_k. Rearranged: 3x_k x_{k+1} + x_k - x_k^2 - 1 = 0. Not sure. Alternatively, think of this as quadratic in x_k: x_k^2 - (3x_{k+1} + 1)x_k + 1 = 0. But not sure. Alternatively, maybe define a new variable. Let me think. Suppose I let x_k = y_k + c, where c is a constant to be determined. Maybe shifting the variable to eliminate the constant term? Alternatively, think of the fixed point. Since we know that 1/2 is a fixed point, maybe set x_k = 1/2 + e_k, where e_k is a small error term. Then expand the recursion in terms of e_k. But since we need exact values, this might not help unless we can find a pattern. Alternatively, maybe consider that the sequence is designed to have periodicity. For example, if after some steps, it cycles through certain values. Let me check if x3 is related to x1 somehow. For example, maybe x3 is something like 1/x1 or similar? Earlier, x1 = 25/11, x2 = 157/275, x3 = 19033/43175. Let me check if x3 is related to x1. Let me compute 1/x1 = 11/25. Compare with x2 = 157/275. 157/275 = (157/11)/25 = approx 14.27/25. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe there's a relation between x1 and x3. Let me compute x1 * x3: (25/11) * (19033/43175). Let me compute numerator: 25 * 19033 = 475825. Denominator: 11 * 43175 = 474925. So 475825 / 474925 ≈ 1.0019... Not exactly 1. So not reciprocal. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the numerators and denominators. Let me write down the terms: x1 = 25/11 x2 = 157/275 x3 = 19033/43175 Wait, let me check denominators: Denominator of x1: 11 Denominator of x2: 275 = 11 * 25 Denominator of x3: 43175. Let me check if 43175 is 275 * something. 275 * 157 = 43175. Yes! Because earlier, when
