REASONING TRACE:

Okay, so I need to find the number of ordered pairs (x, y) where both x and y are integers between -100 and 100, inclusive, that satisfy the equation 12x² - xy - 6y² = 0. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. First, maybe I can try to factor the equation or simplify it somehow. Let me write down the equation again: 12x² - xy - 6y² = 0. Hmm, this looks like a quadratic in terms of x or y. Maybe I can treat it as a quadratic equation in x and try to solve for x in terms of y, or vice versa. Let me try that. Let me consider this as a quadratic in x. So, rearranged: 12x² - yx - 6y² = 0. So, if I think of this as ax² + bx + c = 0, then a = 12, b = -y, and c = -6y². Then, using the quadratic formula, x would be: x = [y ± √(y² - 4 * 12 * (-6y²))]/(2 * 12) Let me compute the discriminant: Discriminant D = y² - 4 * 12 * (-6y²) = y² + 288y² = 289y². Oh, that's nice! The discriminant is a perfect square, which is good because that means the roots are rational if y is rational. Since y is an integer, this discriminant is a perfect square, so we can proceed. So, x = [y ± √(289y²)] / 24. But √(289y²) is √(289) * √(y²) = 17 * |y|. However, since we are dealing with integers, and y is an integer between -100 and 100, |y| is just the absolute value of y. But since we have ±, we need to be careful with the sign. Wait, but let me think. The square root of y² is |y|, so √(289y²) = 17|y|. Therefore, substituting back: x = [y ± 17|y|]/24. Hmm, so this expression depends on the sign of y. Let me consider two cases: y ≥ 0 and y < 0. Case 1: y ≥ 0. Then |y| = y, so: x = [y ± 17y]/24. So, two possibilities: First, with the plus sign: x = (y + 17y)/24 = 18y / 24 = (3y)/4. Second, with the minus sign: x = (y - 17y)/24 = (-16y)/24 = (-2y)/3. Case 2: y < 0. Then |y| = -y, so: x = [y ± 17*(-y)] / 24. Let me compute both possibilities: First, with the plus sign: x = [y + (-17y)] / 24 = (-16y)/24 = (-2y)/3. Second, with the minus sign: x = [y - (-17y)] / 24 = (y + 17y)/24 = 18y / 24 = (3y)/4. Wait, interesting! So regardless of the sign of y, the solutions for x are x = (3y)/4 and x = (-2y)/3. However, since y is negative in case 2, let me check if these expressions are equivalent. Wait, for example, if y is negative, say y = -k where k > 0, then: For case 2, x = (-2y)/3 = (-2*(-k))/3 = 2k/3, and x = (3y)/4 = 3*(-k)/4 = -3k/4. So, in terms of k, these are 2k/3 and -3k/4. But in case 1, if y is positive, then x = 3y/4 and x = -2y/3. So, the solutions are symmetric in a way. But regardless of the sign of y, the solutions for x are x = (3y)/4 and x = (-2y)/3. However, since x must be an integer, these expressions must result in integers. Therefore, for each y, we can check if (3y)/4 and (-2y)/3 are integers. However, since y is an integer, we need to find y such that 3y is divisible by 4 and -2y is divisible by 3. Alternatively, since x must be integer, then: For x = (3y)/4 to be integer, 4 divides 3y. Since 3 and 4 are coprime, this implies that 4 divides y. Similarly, for x = (-2y)/3 to be integer, 3 divides 2y. Since 2 and 3 are coprime, this implies that 3 divides y. Therefore, for each y, if y is divisible by 4, then x = 3y/4 is integer. If y is divisible by 3, then x = -2y/3 is integer. However, note that these are two different conditions. Therefore, the solutions are: Either y is divisible by 4, leading to x = 3y/4, or y is divisible by 3, leading to x = -2y/3. However, we need to check if these solutions are valid for the original equation. Wait, but since we derived these solutions from the quadratic equation, they should satisfy the equation. However, we need to ensure that when we solve for x, we don't have any extraneous solutions. But since we derived them through the quadratic formula, they should be valid. However, we need to make sure that x is integer, which is already considered. Therefore, the solutions are all pairs (x, y) where either: 1. y is divisible by 4, and x = 3y/4, or 2. y is divisible by 3, and x = -2y/3. But we need to be careful here. Because if y is divisible by both 3 and 4, then both solutions would be valid? Let me check. Suppose y is divisible by both 3 and 4, so y is divisible by 12. Then, both x = 3y/4 and x = -2y/3 would be integers. Therefore, for such y, there are two solutions. However, we need to check if these solutions are distinct or not. For example, if y is divisible by 12, then x = 3y/4 and x = -2y/3. Let me check if they are the same: Suppose y = 12k. Then x1 = 3*(12k)/4 = 9k, and x2 = -2*(12k)/3 = -8k. So unless k = 0, these are different. Therefore, for y divisible by 12, we have two distinct solutions. However, when y = 0, then x = 0 in both cases. So, for y = 0, both solutions give x = 0. Therefore, in that case, it's a single solution. Therefore, in general, for each y, the number of solutions is: - 0 if y is not divisible by 4 or 3, - 1 if y is divisible by 4 or 3 but not both, - 2 if y is divisible by both 4 and 3 (i.e., divisible by 12), except when y = 0, which gives only one solution (since both expressions give x = 0). Wait, but when y = 0, both expressions give x = 0. So, even though y is divisible by both 4 and 3, the two solutions for x are the same. Therefore, for y = 0, there is only one solution (x = 0). For other y divisible by both 4 and 3 (i.e., y divisible by 12), there are two distinct solutions. Therefore, to count the total number of ordered pairs (x, y), we need to: 1. Find all y between -100 and 100 inclusive such that y is divisible by 4, and for each such y, compute x = 3y/4. However, we need to check if x is also within -100 to 100. 2. Similarly, find all y between -100 and 100 inclusive such that y is divisible by 3, and for each such y, compute x = -2y/3. Again, check if x is within the range. 3. However, we need to account for overlaps where y is divisible by both 3 and 4 (i.e., divisible by 12), so that we don't double-count the pairs where both solutions are valid. But since for those y, the two solutions (x = 3y/4 and x = -2y/3) are distinct except when y = 0, we need to make sure we count them appropriately. Alternatively, perhaps we can use inclusion-exclusion. Let me think. Let me denote: A = set of y such that y is divisible by 4, B = set of y such that y is divisible by 3. Then, the total number of solutions is: Number of solutions from A (excluding overlaps) + Number of solutions from B (excluding overlaps) + Number of overlaps (but considering that overlaps contribute two solutions except for y=0). Wait, maybe it's better to think of it as: Total solutions = (number of y in A with x = 3y/4 valid) + (number of y in B with x = -2y/3 valid) - (number of y in A ∩ B with both solutions valid, but since they are different except for y=0, we need to adjust for overcounting? Wait, no. Because if we take all y in A and all y in B, then for y in A ∩ B, they are counted in both A and B. However, for each such y, we have two different x values (unless y=0). Therefore, if we just take |A| + |B|, we would be overcounting the cases where y is in both A and B, but actually, for each such y, there are two solutions. However, if we just take |A| + |B|, then for each y in A ∩ B, we are counting two solutions (one from A and one from B). Wait, but actually, for each y in A ∩ B, there are two solutions (x1 and x2). However, if we take |A|, which counts all y in A (including those in A ∩ B), and then |B|, which counts all y in B (including those in A ∩ B), then the total number of solutions would be |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|? Wait, no. Wait, each y in A contributes one solution (x = 3y/4), and each y in B contributes one solution (x = -2y/3). However, if a y is in both A and B, then it contributes two solutions. Therefore, the total number of solutions is |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|? No, that would be if we were counting the number of y's, but here we are counting the number of (x, y) pairs. Wait, no. Let me think again. Each y in A gives one solution (x1, y). Each y in B gives one solution (x2, y). However, if y is in both A and B, then both solutions (x1, y) and (x2, y) are valid. Therefore, the total number of solutions is |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|? No, that formula is for counting the number of elements in the union. Wait, no, if you have two sets, the total number of elements in their union is |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. But here, we are not taking the union of solutions, but rather, for each y in A, we have one solution, and for each y in B, we have another solution. However, if a y is in both A and B, then it contributes two solutions. Therefore, the total number of solutions is |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|? No, that would be if we were counting the number of unique y's. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of it as: Total solutions = number of solutions from A + number of solutions from B - number of solutions that are counted in both A and B. But if a solution (x, y) is in both A and B, meaning that y is in both A and B, and the solution comes from both A and B. Wait, but for a given y, if it is in both A and B, then there are two different solutions (x1, y) and (x2, y). Therefore, the total number of solutions is |A| + |B|. Because for each y in A, you have one solution, and for each y in B, you have another solution. However, if a y is in both A and B, then you have two solutions for that y. Therefore, the total number of solutions is |A| + |B|. However, we need to check if the x values are within the range [-100, 100]. Wait, but we need to ensure that for each y in A, x = 3y/4 is within the range, and similarly for y in B, x = -2y/3 is within the range. Therefore, maybe the approach is: 1. Find all integers y between -100 and 100 inclusive such that y is divisible by 4, and compute x = 3y/4. Check if x is also between -100 and 100. For each such y, we have a valid (x, y) pair. 2. Similarly, find all integers y between -100 and 100 inclusive such that y is divisible by 3, compute x = -2y/3, check if x is between -100 and 100. For each such y, we have a valid (x, y) pair. 3. However, some y's are divisible by both 3 and 4 (i.e., divisible by 12). For these y's, both solutions (x = 3y/4 and x = -2y/3) are valid. Therefore, these y's contribute two pairs, while others contribute one pair. However, if we just do step 1 and step 2, we might be double-counting the cases where y is divisible by both 3 and 4? Wait, no. Because in step 1, we are considering all y divisible by 4, and in step 2, all y divisible by 3. So, if a y is divisible by both, it is counted in both steps. Therefore, the total number of pairs would be the number of pairs from step 1 plus the number of pairs from step 2. However, if we do that, then for y divisible by both 3 and 4, we have two pairs (from step 1 and step 2). However, we need to check if these pairs are unique or not. For example, if y is divisible by both 3 and 4, then (x1, y) and (x2, y) are two different pairs, unless x1 = x2. Let me check when x1 = x2. Set 3y/4 = -2y/3. Multiply both sides by 12: 9y = -8y => 17y = 0 => y = 0. Therefore, only when y = 0 do the two solutions coincide. Therefore, for all other y divisible by both 3 and 4, the two solutions (x1, y) and (x2, y) are distinct. Therefore, the total number of solutions is indeed |A| + |B|, where |A| is the number of y divisible by 4 with x = 3y/4 in range, and |B| is the number of y divisible by 3 with x = -2y/3 in range. However, we need to make sure that for each y in A and B, the corresponding x is within the range. Therefore, we need to compute |A| and |B|, considering the x range. But maybe there is a better way. Let me think again. Alternatively, since we have the equation 12x² - xy - 6y² = 0, we can factor it. Let me try factoring. Looking at 12x² - xy - 6y². Let me try to factor this quadratic in x or y. Let me try to factor it as (ax + by)(cx + dy) = 0. Multiplying out, we get acx² + (ad + bc)xy + bdy². Comparing with 12x² - xy - 6y², we have: ac = 12, ad + bc = -1, bd = -6. We need integers a, b, c, d such that these equations hold. Let me try to find such integers. Let me think about factors of 12 and -6. First, ac = 12. Let me consider possible factors. Let me try a = 4, c = 3. Then ac = 12. Then bd = -6. Let me try b = 3, d = -2. Then bd = 3*(-2) = -6. Then ad + bc = 4*(-2) + 3*3 = -8 + 9 = 1. But we need ad + bc = -1. Close. If I take b = -3 and d = 2, then bd = -3*2 = -6. Then ad + bc = 4*2 + (-3)*3 = 8 - 9 = -1. Perfect! So, the factorization is (4x - 3y)(3x + 2y) = 0. Let me check: (4x - 3y)(3x + 2y) = 12x² + 8xy - 9xy -6y² = 12x² - xy -6y². Yes! Perfect. Therefore, the equation factors as (4x - 3y)(3x + 2y) = 0. Therefore, the solutions are the solutions to 4x - 3y = 0 or 3x + 2y = 0. Therefore, the original equation is equivalent to 4x - 3y = 0 or 3x + 2y = 0. Therefore, the solutions are all integer pairs (x, y) such that either 4x = 3y or 3x = -2y. Therefore, this simplifies the problem. Now, instead of dealing with quadratics, we can consider these two linear equations. So, let me handle each case separately. Case 1: 4x = 3y. This implies that 4x = 3y. Therefore, x = (3/4)y. Since x must be an integer, y must be divisible by 4. Let me denote y = 4k, where k is an integer. Then x = (3/4)(4k) = 3k. Therefore, all solutions to 4x = 3y are pairs (x, y) = (3k, 4k), where k is an integer. Case 2: 3x + 2y = 0. This implies 3x = -2y, so x = (-2/3)y. Since x must be an integer, y must be divisible by 3. Let me denote y = 3m, where m is an integer. Then x = (-2/3)(3m) = -2m. Therefore, all solutions to 3x + 2y = 0 are pairs (x, y) = (-2m, 3m), where m is an integer. Therefore, the solutions to the original equation are all pairs of the form (3k, 4k) and (-2m, 3m), where k and m are integers. Now, we need to find all such pairs where both x and y are integers between -100 and 100 inclusive. Therefore, we need to find all integers k such that x = 3k and y = 4k are within [-100, 100], and all integers m such that x = -2m and y = 3m are within [-100, 100]. Let me handle each case separately. First, Case 1: (x, y) = (3k, 4k). We need: -100 ≤ 3k ≤ 100, -100
