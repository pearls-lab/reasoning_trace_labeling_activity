We have a Zork game. The player is at Rocky Ledge, can go up, down, maybe climb? Need to explore. Goal is high score. We have an egg, maybe can open later with something. Need to find tools. Classic Zork I: The egg is the "jewel-encrusted egg" that can be opened with a "knife" or "saw"? Actually in Zork, there is a "jewel-encrusted egg" that can be opened with a "knife" or "saw"? I recall the "jewel-encrusted egg" is a "jewel-encrusted egg" that can be opened with a "knife" or "saw"? In Zork I, you need a "knife" to open the egg, then you get a "jewel-encrusted egg" that contains a "jewel-encrusted egg"? Wait. Let's recall: In Zork I, there is a "jewel-encrusted egg" that can be opened with a "knife". Inside is a "jewel-encrusted egg"? Actually the egg contains a "jewel-encrusted egg"? Hmm. I think the egg contains a "jewel-encrusted egg"? No, maybe it contains a "jewel-encrusted egg"? That seems recursive. Actually the egg contains a "jewel-encrusted egg"? Might be a "jewel-encrusted egg" that contains a "jewel-encrusted egg"? Not sure.

But we need to progress: From Rocky Ledge, we can go up to Canyon View, down to canyon bottom? The description says "It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here." So down leads to canyon bottom. Up leads back to Canyon View. Let's go down.
