We have Zork. Player is on a tree branch with a nest containing a jeweled egg. They took the egg. Need to continue exploring. Likely can climb down, go north, etc. Goal is high score. Should maybe examine egg, maybe open it? The egg is hinged and closed with a clasp. Could "open egg" or "unlock egg". Might need a tool. Could also "look" to see surroundings. Let's try "descend" or "down". In Zork, command is "down". So we can go down the tree. Also could "examine egg". Let's do "examine egg".
