We need to continue playing Zork. The player has a jewel-encrusted egg. They are at End of Rainbow location. They tried to break egg, got prompt "What do you want to break the egg with?" So we need to specify an object, maybe "with knife" or "with rock". Do we have any items? We have the egg in inventory, and maybe the leaf? We have a leaflet (read). No other items. Could we use "with hands"? Might not work. In Zork, there is a "jewel-encrosed egg" that is a key to something? Actually in Zork I recall a "jewel-encrusted egg" that is a "jewel-encrusted egg" that can be opened with a "saw" or "knife"? Not sure. In Zork I think there is a "jewel-encrusted egg" that is a "jewel-encrusted egg" that can be "open egg" but you need a "saw". The egg is a "jewel-encrusted egg" that is a "jewel-encrusted egg" that can be "open egg" with a "saw". The saw is found in the "Attic"? Actually in Zork I recall a "saw" in the "Attic" of the house. The egg is a "jewel-encrusted egg" that is a "jewel-encrusted egg" that can be "open egg" with a "saw". So we need to get a saw. But we are far from the house. We could go back to the house. Let's try to go east? At End of Rainbow, east is blocked. The path continues southwest. We could go southwest back to Canyon Bottom, then north to Canyon View, then east? Actually from Canyon Bottom north leads to End of Rainbow. So to go back to Canyon View, we need to go south? Wait: At Canyon Bottom, north is End of Rainbow. So to go back, we go south? Actually we came from Canyon Bottom north to End of Rainbow. So to go back, we go south. Let's try "south".
