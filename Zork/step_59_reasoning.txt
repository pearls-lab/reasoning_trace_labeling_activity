We have a Zork game. The player is stuck because the interface is not recognizing commands? The system says "I don't know the word "(empty)". That suggests the assistant is sending empty commands, causing the game to respond with that error. Need to send a valid command.

Current location: Forest Path (the path winding through a dimly lit forest). The description: path heads north-south, large tree with low branches at edge. The player is on the ground (since they went down). They have the jewel-encrusted egg in inventory. They also have the leaflet maybe.

Goal: Continue exploring. Perhaps go east to the sunlight? The forest description earlier: "Forest. This is a forest, with trees in all directions. To the east, there appears to be sunlight." So from Forest (the generic forest) they went east to Forest Path. Now they can go east again? Let's try "east". That might lead to a clearing with sunlight? Or maybe "south" leads back to clearing. Let's try "south". But they are at Forest Path, which leads north-south. South leads back to clearing. Already there. Maybe go east from forest path? Not sure.

Better to go "west" maybe leads to something else. Let's try "east".
