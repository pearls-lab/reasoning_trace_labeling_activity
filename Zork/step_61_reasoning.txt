We need to continue playing Zork. The player is in a clearing with path east and west. We have an egg (jewel-enclosed) in inventory. Need to find ways to open it maybe with a tool. In Zork, there is a "egg" that can be opened with a "knife" or "saw"? Actually in Zork I recall a "jewel-encrusted egg" that can be opened with a "knife" or "saw"? Let's recall: In Zork I, there is a "jewel-encrusted egg" that can be opened with a "knife" or "saw"? I think you need a "knife" to open it. The knife is found in the "attic" of the house? Actually in Zork I, there is a "knife" in the "attic" of the house (the white house). The player hasn't entered the house yet because door is boarded. There is a "mailbox" with a leaflet. The house is boarded, but you can go around to the back? The house has a "back door"? In Zork I, you can go around the house to the back (south side) and find a "door" that is not boarded? Actually the house has a "front door" boarded, but you can go around to the back and find a "door" that is unlocked? I think you need to go "south" from the house to the "forest" and then "west" to the "forest path" and then "north" to the "clearing"? Not sure.

We are currently at a clearing with path east and west. We need to explore east and west to find items. Let's go east.
