We are at West of House, with a white house, boarded front door, mailbox. We tried east (into house) but blocked. Need to go north? Let's recall Zork I map. West of House location: you can go north to forest? Actually West of House is open field west of house. Directions: north leads to forest? Let's recall: Starting location West of House. Options: go east (blocked), go north (to forest), go south (to ...?). I think north leads to forest, south leads to ... maybe a path? Actually from West of House you can go north to forest, east to house (blocked), south to ... maybe a path to the road? Let's try north.
We need to see response.
